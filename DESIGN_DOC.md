Living Fractals Travelling Through the Book-World
Version Date: February 21, 2026 (revised emphasis on emergence)
Core Metaphor
The text stream is a perfect, pre-existing multidimensional landscape (the book-world) already populated with atomic base-token fractals. The system is a traveller moving sequentially through this terrain. Survival and growth depend on minimizing energy spent per unit distance travelled — achieved by evolving super-tokens that allow increasingly accurate, low-cost anticipation of future landscape.
First Principle – Strict Emergence
No super-token is born an "orchestrator", "specialist", "generalist" or any other role.
All super-tokens start from the same minimal genome template.
Differentiation into coherent behavioral strategies (reliable frequent contributors vs rare high-impact interveners vs other possible personas) arises solely from differential survival and reproduction under the energy gradients described below.
1. Core Entities (all emergent)
Entity
Description
Origin
Evolutionary pressure gradient
Base Tokens
Static atomic fractals, one per vocabulary item, always correct.
Given by the environment (fixed)
Expensive to discover directly → strong pressure to anticipate them.
Super-Tokens
Composite fractals grown via minting / symbiogenesis.
Minted from resonant coalitions
Fitness = net energy saved per distance travelled.
Gap Field
The living multidimensional space / shared terrain itself. Circular buffer of emitted attractor points + metadata (position, energy, velocity, phase, omega, emitter ID).
The medium in which everything lives
Collective short-term memory; patterns propagate via geometric resonance.
2. Global Dynamics – Energy-Efficient Traversal
Frontier / Cursor
Single read position in the stream. Advances one token (or small window) per global timestep.
Energy Ledger (global traveller + per-super-token)
Base travel toll — fixed tiny cost per position advanced (time passes).
Discovery cost — high per base-token when directly revealed (surprise / mismatch).
Attempt cost — moderate-to-high whenever a super-token activates and proposes a prediction segment.
Silence credit — small positive rebate per timestep of inactivity. Grows slowly at first, then faster (log or exponential curve). Capped very low for strategies that activate frequently; effectively uncapped for strategies that activate very rarely.
Jackpot reward — large one-time bonus on correct prediction. Scales with:
rarity of predicted segment (inverse log-frequency or online IDF)
length / complexity of correct match
match quality
accumulated silent timesteps (very strong multiplier for long-dormant strategies)
Prediction vs Discovery
Super-token with high confidence proposes next segment → strong match → glide forward cheaply (cursor advances, energy rebate).
Mismatch → pay discovery cost × unmatched length → force-activate real base tokens → incorporate them (refine self or mint new super-token).
3. Parallel Multi-Round Chaos Game (Signalling & Turn-Taking Medium)
Every global timestep = K short synchronized rounds (K ≈ 4–12, tunable or energy-modulated).
Per round (all currently active super-tokens in parallel):
Read current gap state (includes emissions from previous round of this timestep).
Compute resonance vector (geometric + phase + velocity gating).
Perform one chaos game iteration on private IFS → new attractor point.
Emit new point immediately → gap updates for next round.
No explicit roles or classes — behavioural differentiation emerges because:
Super-tokens that emit frequently, with low amplitude, repetitive geometric motifs → tend to accumulate small steady rebates + enable other strategies → survive reliably (orchestrator-like attractor).
Super-tokens that emit very rarely, with high amplitude, highly specific geometry → accumulate large silence credit + occasional huge jackpots → survive via rare big wins (specialist-like attractor).
Super-tokens that emit too often and inaccurately → pay constant attempt costs + mismatch penalties → die out.
The parallel rounds themselves create the signalling substrate:
Early rounds dominated by frequent emitters → faint, repetitive priming waves ("structural expectation slots").
Later rounds allow rare emitters to respond only when resonance is extremely high → precise interventions.
4. Super-Token Genome (uniform starting point, evolvable traits)
All super-tokens begin from the same minimal template. Differentiation arises through mutation, selection, and symbiogenesis.
Evolvable Trait
Description
Selection gradient effect
IFS parameters
Affine maps defining private chaos game trajectory
Shapes that resonate usefully with upcoming terrain survive.
Activation threshold
Confidence needed to emit a proposal
Low → frequent small contributions; very high → rare big wins.
Emission amplitude / decay
Strength and persistence of emitted points
Low amp + long decay → steady scaffolding; high amp + short decay → rare sharp interventions.
Silence credit growth rate
How fast rebate accumulates during inactivity
Slow growth → frequent activation; fast/exponential → rare activation rewarded.
Resonance filter shape
Geometric / phase preference for incoming gap patterns
Broad → responds to many contexts; narrow → responds only to specific cues.
5. Minting / Symbiogenesis (emergent coalition binding)
Triggered when a coalition of super-tokens consistently enables cheap traversal together (high joint energy savings).
Child inherits blended traits (IFS average + interpolated emission / silence / filter parameters).
Successful fusions inherit energy windfall → larger predictive reach.
No pre-defined "types" — fusions between frequent + rare strategists naturally produce hybrid or higher-order personas.
6. Key Selection Pressures (no hand-crafted categories)
Pressure
Favors emergence of …
Prevents …
High attempt cost + mismatch penalty
Very high activation thresholds → rare activation
Constant over-prediction / delusional strategies
Exponential silence credit growth
Long-dormant strategies that wait for perfect moments
Hyperactive low-reward emitters
Rarity-scaled jackpot
Narrow specialists on Zipf tail
Generalists trying to cover everything
Low-cost frequent emission rebate
Steady scaffolding of structural patterns
Complete silence (no one coordinates)
Discovery cost when surprised
Accurate anticipation of future terrain
Ignoring upcoming base tokens
These gradients are sufficient to make Zipf-like division of labor (frequent reliable backbone vs rare high-impact interveners) an evolutionarily stable outcome — without ever naming the categories in advance.
7. Expected Emergent Personas (not pre-defined)
Steady-state frequent predictors (grammar / function-word scaffolds)
Long-dormant rare-pattern specialists (low-frequency lexical items)
Hybrid coordinator–specialist fusions
Possibly: short-burst refiners, error-correctors, meta-predictors of prediction confidence, etc.
8. Next Steps for Prototyping
Minimal toy corpus (100–500 token vocab, short sentences with clear Zipf distribution).
Uniform starting genome for all minted super-tokens.
Implement energy ledger + parallel K-round chaos game loop.
Add silence credit curve + rarity-scaled jackpot.
Run long enough to observe whether frequency-based behavioral clusters appear without any explicit type labels.
This version stays true to "let mother nature do the work" while still providing strong, coherent selection gradients that make the desired division of labor (and potentially many others) highly probable.


of course, if a super token runs out of energy, they die, perhaps energy sharing is a nice addition later on.
